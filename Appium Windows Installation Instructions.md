### Test Environment Variables
* Run `C:\> java -version` in CMD. You should see something close to this `java version "1.8.0_144"` or greater returned.
* Run `C:\> ruby -v` in CMD. You should see something close to this `ruby 2.2.4` or greater.
* Run `c:\> emulator -help`. You should see menu options for android emulator manager.
* Run `c:\> npm`. You should see the npm menu options.
* If any of the above is not working check to make sure the install locations are correct and reflected correctly in the path environment variable.

### Install Ruby Development Kit
* Download and install [32-bit](http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2-20130224-1151-sfx.exe) or [64-bit](http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2-20130224-1432-sfx.exe)
* Extract the files to `c:\ruby-dev-kit`.
* Open CMD and goto `cd c:\ruby-dev-kit`
* Run `ruby dk.rb init`
* Run `ruby dk.rb install`
* Test the installation by running `gem install json --platform=ruby --source http://rubygems.org` in CMD. You should see "1 gem installed" if all goes well.
* Find more Devkit installation information [here](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit).
* Note: If you still get a SSL error, do the following:
   * Open a PowerShell terminal
   * Copy the cacert.pem file to your Ruby directory. e.g. copy C:\Users\**your_user_name**\appium-workshop\cacert.pem C:\Ruby22-x64
   * Run: `set SSL_CERT_FILE=C:\Ruby22-x64\cacert.pem`
   * Try installing the gem again. Hopefully this resolve any SSL issues going forward.

### Verify Platform-tools are installed
* Run `c:\> adb` in CMD. You should see this `Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.32` and additional menu options.

### Create Android Emulator
* Run `android create avd -n EM1 -k "system-images;android-23;google_apis;x86"` in CMD.
* Enter NO to not create a custom hardware profile.

### Run Emulator
* Run the emulator: `emulator -avd EM1`
* Note: You might see an error like this "[7264]:ERROR:./android/qt/qt_setup.cpp:28:Qt library not found at ..\emulator\lib64\qt\lib". It's a known problem with the latest Android SDK. There are two ways to get around this. 
   * 1. Open a powershell terminal and run the command in there. 
   * 2. Run it from the sdk/tools directory. e.g. cd C:\Users\yourUser\AppData\Local\Android\sdk and then `emulator -avd EM1`
* Verify avd output on startup includes:
   * Hax is enabled
   * HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virt mode.
* Verify emulator fully starts and you see the android home/desktop screen.
* Note: Emulator can also be created via the AVD Manager IDE inside of Android Studio. However, you would need to create a new project or import one to see this menu option.

### Install Appium Desktop
* Download, unzip and install [here](https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases/download/v1.2.1/appium-desktop-Setup-1.2.1.exe)

* Create desktop icon.

### Install Appium Doctor via NPM
* Run `C:\> npm install -g appium-doctor`
* Run `C:\> appium-doctor` (checks setup is correct on machine)
	*  	Verify "info AppiumDoctor Everything looks good, bye!" is displayed.
	* If there are things missing please go back to the install instructions or environment variable setup.

### Install Appium via NPM
* Run `C:\> npm install -g appium`
	* Verify appium installed correctly by doing `C:\> appium -v`
* Note: You might get an error when install appium with NPM. If so, open a powershell window as administrator. e.g. search for powershell in start menu, then right click powershell and select run as administrator.
	* In powershell run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force`
	* Run: `npm install -g npm-windows-upgrade`
	* Run: `npm-windows-upgrade`
	* Run: `npm install -g appium`
* Note: Your machine might complain that the PYTHON environment variable is missing. Not sure why this occurs, though. However, the Appium binary is still installed and should not intefer with our use.

### Install Sublime (We should all use same editor)
* Download and install [64-bit](https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%

### Install Allure Report Framework
* Download and unzip allure [here](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure1/releases/download/allure-core-1.5.0/allure-commandline.zip)
* Create a allure directory. Run `mkdir C:\allure`
* Move all allure folders/files from Downloads to C:\allure.

	* Goto Control Panel\System and Security\System > Advanced system > Edit Variables...
	* Under "User variables for **your_user_name**"
	* Highlight the Path variable.
	* Click Edit > New
	* Add path for allure executables. e.g. C:\allure\bin
	* Click OK
* Close shell windows and open a new one.
